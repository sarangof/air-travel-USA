# Delays in USA domestic flights (1987-2008)
(Playing with [RITA data.] (http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html) )

Created a "vulnerability" index, ranking airports in terms of their importance in the domestic flights network (number of conections) and their average arrival and departure delays.

* Also showed that, on average (comparing the same trips), the scheduled length of trips has increased, whereas the on-time performance has not improved significantly.
